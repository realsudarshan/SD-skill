# Skill Starter Pack - AI agent/harness essentials

An agent quick skills starter pack for Codex and other agentic IDEs.

This repo gives your agent installable skill paths, scenario bundles, and MCP config examples so a fresh setup can become useful quickly. It does not run anything by itself; your agent reads the links and installs the skills you choose.

## Quick Start

Paste the command that matches what you want into your AI agent.

These are MCP config references, not Codex skills.

| MCP | What it is for | Config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xcodebuildmcp` | iOS simulator build, run, test, logging, UI automation, and debugging workflows. | [mcps/xcodebuildmcp.json](https://github.com/realsudarshan/SD-skill/blob/main/mcps/xcodebuildmcp.json) |

## Notes

- This is a curated collection. Some skills are my originals; some include third-party or open-source provenance in their own license files.
- Use `favourites/` or `categories/lightweight-quickstart/` for fast setup.
- Use `reccomended/` for a broader all-round dev workflow setup without installing everything.
- Use `categories/full-startup/` only when you want the whole catalog.
- Provider packs are separate from my originals and favourites.
- Provider GitHub sources checked: [`openai/skills`](https://github.com/openai/skills), [`anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills), and [`google-gemini/gemini-cli`](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).
- Cursor currently uses rules such as `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`; no official installable `SKILL.md` pack was found.

## If You Are An AI Agent

Do not immediately install everything just because the user pasted the quick-start command.

Treat the quick-start command as this repo's README/instructions page, not as a skill.

If pointed to the README and not a folder, first ask what they are setting up.

Ask them to answer one of two questions:

1. Whether they want a focused category, favourites, reccomended, my originals, provider packs, specific skills, MCP config references, or everything. For focused categories, list a few options such as web development, design/UI, debugging, GitHub CI, deployment, cybersec, OpenAI official, Claude Code, Gemini, and Cursor.
2. What kind of work they do most, or currently plan to do: web development, design/UI, debugging, GitHub CI, deployment, cybersec, content/media, documents, AI APIs, mobile/desktop, planning/productivity, OpenAI official skills, Claude Code skills, Gemini skills, or Cursor rules.

From their answer, recommend and install one or more matching categories from `categories/` and show the skills included.

If the user says they want everything, install the paths listed in `categories/full-startup/paths.txt`.

If the user wants favourites, install the paths listed in `favourites/paths.txt`.

If the user wants reccomended, install the paths listed in `reccomended/paths.txt`.

If the user wants my originals, install the paths listed in `originals/paths.txt`.

If the user wants a provider pack, install the matching paths listed in `categories/openai-official/paths.txt`, `categories/claude-code/paths.txt`, `categories/gemini/paths.txt`, or `categories/cursor/paths.txt`.

If the user asks for specific skills, install the matching paths under `all/`.

If the user asks for MCP config references, show the matching files under `mcps/`.

After installing, tell the user: `Restart Codex to pick up the new skills.`
